Google News Keywords from Tags uses your post tags to insert Google News keywords meta tag to your posts. 

== Description ==

In September 2012, Google announced "news_keywords" meta tag which is intended to help Google News to properly classify content and make it more discoverable for users.

This plugin picks your posts' tags and uses them to generate "news_keywords" meta tag. No need to set up anything, it's all done automatically. If a post has no tags Google News Keywords meta tag will not be displayed. You can use up to ten Google News keywords, so don't go too tag happy.
